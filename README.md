# Nano Framework support in IDEA

Implements a silly IntelliJ IDEA plugin for nano framework.

Implements:

* post-startup activity to announce that framework is found
* implicit usage provider
* inspection with fix
* line markers
* Inlay parameter hints: they override those that IDEA has and cannot be extended
